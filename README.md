# cx_oracle-insert
This python script can import millions of data on to an Oracle database from a local network drive in minutes.

This was made possible using Oracle's cx_oracle library. I created functions that prepars and imports the data on to an Oracle database server. I've also added logging feature so if the script is run using the command prompt, you get updates the processes status within the script.
